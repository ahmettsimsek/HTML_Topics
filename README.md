# HTML Camp Step 1

# Personal Website (HTML Practice)

This project is a personal website that I built using pure HTML while learning the fundamentals of web development.

## 🚀 What I Practiced

- Semantic HTML tags (header, main, section, footer)
- Lists and tables
- Forms and input types
- Audio and video embedding
- iframe usage
- Basic JavaScript interaction
- Page structure

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

The goal of this project is to reinforce my HTML knowledge by building a real webpage from memory instead of following tutorials.

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to structure a webpage properly
- When to use semantic elements
- Creating user forms
- Embedding media content
- Writing cleaner and more readable HTML

## 🔥 Next Steps

- Convert inline CSS to external stylesheet
- Learn Flexbox and Grid
- Make the page responsive
- Improve UI design
- Turn this into a real portfolio website
